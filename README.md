Things I created on or for an ARM based computer

I plan to have multiple projects for this device within this repo

 * vue-auto-user   - Web based app that can auto create an account for a visitor.
                     Visitors choose a login name and supply a public key.
                     On successful creation the visitor will be able to login
                     using SSH, their chosen login name and public key.

 * Next?
